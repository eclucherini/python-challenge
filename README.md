Module 3 Python Challenge

PyBank:
This challenge was particularly difficult, as I continued to run into various errors that required extensive Googling and assistance from AskBCS Learning Assistant. 

In particular, I continued to receve an error saying "ValueError: I/O operation on closed file". Once I figured out that my loops needed to occur within the 'open with' code, so that they wouldn't try to loop through a closed file, this greatly improved my speed. 

Most of my Google searches led me to StackOverflow and GeeksforGeeks. I also found the resources Anthony provides before class to be helpful in reframing my mindset. 

An issue I ran into in Googling was that many of the solutions were with Pandas (e.g. easily summing the Profit/Loss column), so I included "-pandas" to avoid that, since I'm sure we are not supposed to use what we learned in class about Pandas this week in last week's challenge. 


PyPoll:
This was actually easier than PyBank, perhaps because I already had completed PyBank and could reuse some of its methods in PyPoll. 

I ran into the similar problem of needing to do more within the 'open with' code than I really would prefer, even with my attempts to create new lists of the data in the csv columns to be able to reference later. Because of this, my unique candidates output occurs after counting the votes for each candidate, which I recognize would not make sense in the normal course of business. 

StackOverflow was incredibly helpful, particularly in small questions, like how to iterate over a list that I had forgotten. Similar to PyBank, I also used the class resources as much as possible, knowing that there are methods included in those that we don't necessarily cover in class.
